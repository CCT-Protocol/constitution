## 1. Vision & Mission
**CCT Protocol** is building the decentralized infrastructure for community manufacturing. 

Unlike traditional centralized platforms that act as rent-seeking intermediaries, CCT operates as a **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)**. [cite_start]Our mission is to unite engineers, designers, and validators in a transparent ecosystem governed by the core principle: **"Contribution = Governance."** [cite: 8, 84]

### The Problem
* [cite_start]**Trust Deficit:** Users cannot verify if a 3D file is printable or safe without testing it themselves. [cite: 86]
* [cite_start]**Misaligned Incentives:** Creators sell a design once and lose all future rights. [cite: 87]
* [cite_start]**Lack of Standards:** No unified standard exists for validating peer-to-peer industrial assets. [cite: 88]

## 2. Core Governance: The Constitution
This repository hosts the living governing documents of the CCT Network.

### [cite_start]Membership Tiers [cite: 12]
1.  **Consumers:** End users purchasing designs.
2.  **Citizens:** Community members (Discord).
3.  **Token Holders:** Voters holding $CCT.
4.  **Contributors (The Workforce):** Designers, Validators, and Developers.
5.  **Guardians (The Council):** Strategic execution and security.

### The Guardian Council
* [cite_start]**Composition:** 5 Seats (Appointed in Genesis Phase, Elected in Phase 3). [cite: 29, 30]
* [cite_start]**Powers:** Manage Multi-Sig Treasury, vet code/IP, emergency response. [cite: 34]
* [cite_start]**Accountability:** Subject to removal via "Vote of No Confidence" (>66% Supermajority). [cite: 41, 42]

## 3. Roadmap
* **Phase 1 (Genesis):** Off-chain governance. Community building. (Current Status) [cite_start][cite: 70]
* **Phase 2 (Testnet):** Technical MVP live. [cite_start]Points system migration. [cite: 72]
* **Phase 3 (Mainnet):** The Decentralization Event. [cite_start]Token launch on public blockchain. [cite: 73]

## 4. Legal & Disclaimer
**Utility Status:** CCT is a cryptographic utility token. [cite_start]It is NOT a security, share, or financial instrument. [cite: 109]

**Dissolution Priority (Genesis Clause):**
In the event of a winding up prior to Phase 3, assets are distributed to **Technical Contributors (Tier 1)** first. [cite_start]This ensures those who build the code are compensated before promoters or advisors. [cite: 63]
