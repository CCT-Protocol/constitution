## 1. Vision & Mission
**CCT Protocol** is building the decentralized infrastructure for community manufacturing. 

Unlike traditional centralized platforms that act as rent-seeking intermediaries, CCT operates as a **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)**. [cite_start]Our mission is to unite engineers, designers, and validators in a transparent ecosystem governed by the core principle: **"Contribution = Governance."** 

### The Problem
  **Trust Deficit:** Users cannot verify if a 3D file is printable or safe without testing it themselves. 
  **Misaligned Incentives:** Creators sell a design once and lose all future rights. 
  **Lack of Standards:** No unified standard exists for validating peer-to-peer industrial assets.

## 2. Core Governance: The Constitution
This repository hosts the living governing documents of the CCT Network.

### Membership Tiers 
1.  **Consumers:** End users purchasing designs.
2.  **Citizens:** Community members (Discord).
3.  **Token Holders:** Voters holding $CCT.
4.  **Contributors (The Workforce):** Designers, Validators, and Developers.
5.  **Guardians (The Council):** Strategic execution and security.

### The Guardian Council
  **Composition:** 5 Seats (Appointed in Genesis Phase, Elected in Phase 3). 
  **Powers:** Manage Multi-Sig Treasury, vet code/IP, emergency response. 
  **Accountability:** Subject to removal via "Vote of No Confidence" (>66% Supermajority).

## 3. Roadmap
* **Phase 1 (Genesis):** Off-chain governance. Community building. (Current Status) 
* **Phase 2 (Testnet):** Technical MVP live. [cite_start]Points system migration. 
* **Phase 3 (Mainnet):** The Decentralization Event. [cite_start]Token launch on public blockchain.

## 4. Legal & Disclaimer
**Utility Status:** CCT is a cryptographic utility token. [cite_start]It is NOT a security, share, or financial instrument. 

**Dissolution Priority (Genesis Clause):**
In the event of a winding up prior to Phase 3, assets are distributed to **Technical Contributors (Tier 1)** first. [cite_start]This ensures those who build the code are compensated before promoters or advisors.
